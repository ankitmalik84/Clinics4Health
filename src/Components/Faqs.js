      question: "Eligibility and Benefit Verification",
      answer:
        "In general, we check whether the patient policy is still active or not on the given treatment date and also check whether the service provided by the doctor comes under that policy. So for the purpose of reviewing eligibility and benefits, the provider or any of his staff is supposed to verify the patient policy by calling or checking on the insurer’s website. For California Workers’ Compensation, We ensure your claim reaches the right party and gets paid timely as we verify in detail the injured worker’s claim information, accepted body parts, and payer information before sending your claims to the party.<br/><br/>Our work is to take care of all your insurance verification needs and can provide you with details regarding patients, also reducing the number of denials and achieving more fabulous collections at the first attempt.",

      question: "Account Receivable Resolution",
      answer:
        "Once we submit claims to insurance companies electronically or by paper mail, we continuously keep tracking to ensure provider claims reach the payer timely and they get paid. We keep a check by calling insurance companies and looking over their website activity.<br/><br/>We have simplified the process for our clients and classified Account Receivable resolution into 3 phases:<br/><br/>Phase I – Initial evaluation of medical Account Receivable Follow-up<br/><br/>We begin the follow-up process after running the aging report within 15-20 days of electronic claim submission. Our focus is on ensuring that each claim has reached the correct payer. We take care that for any additional information or some other reason, no claim gets refused by the insurance company, and ordinarily, private companies process the claim within the same time frame.<br/><br/>If there is any denial by the insurance company due to any inaccurate reason, we need 15 days to document the same for follow-up, but we mostly try to resolve it on call.<br/><br/>Phase II – Analysis and prioritizing medical Account Receivable Follow-up<br/><br/>Our experienced medical A/R analysts begin this phase by discovering various issues for uncollectible claims (marked as bad or invalid) or claims where the contracted rate is not paid to the carrier.<br/><br/>Our team ensures that “clean claims” will be reimbursed according to the contracted fee schedule. We check the filing/appeal limits of the major carriers. We ensure that claims must stick to the correct processing unit by checking the claims submission address.<br/><br/>Phase III – Collecting the maximum of medical Account Receivable Follow-up<br/><br/>Once verification of all the essential billing information (Claims processing address and other medical billing rules) is found accurate, only then re-filing is possible. For this, our team will analyze claims that are supposed to be within the filing limit of the carrier.<br/><br/>Additionally, supporting documents are required for claims exceeding the filing limit of the carrier and claims that turn up to be underpaid by the carrier. Appeal procedures differ considerably depending on the plan, carrier, and state. Pile up these procedures and implement them on claims that are being appealed.<br/><br/>Wherever possible, we will pass the claims electronically to the carrier or through a clearinghouse for other carriers. We will forward the claims and follow up for confirmation.<br/><br/>Accomplishment to medical Account Receivable recovery<br/><br/>The significant achievement of the Cash Acceleration Program depends on several factors:<br/>Undoubtedly, the completeness and accuracy of the account data provided are of prime importance. In order to perform extensive collection efforts, Clincs4Health Solutions provides the protocols, expertise, and other necessary resources. We have received full support and high-level cooperation from the provider’s office for our successful programs.",
